# Surveil

## Public Health Surveillance

<img src="man/figures/logo.png" align="right" width="160" />

The **surveil** R package provides time series models for routine public health surveillance tasks: model time trends in mortality or disease incidence rates to make inferences about health inequalities, cumulative and period percent change, and age-standardized rates. 

**surveil** is an interface to [Stan](https://mc-stan.org), a state-of-the-art platform for Bayesian inference. 

### Installation

This project is still under development.

### Usage

Model time series data of mortality or disease incidence by loading the **surveil** package into R together with disease surveillance data. Tables exported from CDC WONDER are automatically in the correct format.

```{r}
library(surveil)
library(knitr)
data(cancer)

kable(head(cancer), 
      booktabs = TRUE,
      caption = "Table 1. A glimpse of cancer surveillance data")
```

Model trends in risk and easily obtain functions of risk estimates, such as cumulative percent change:

```{r message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
fit <- stan_rw(data = cancer,
               time = Year,
               group = Age)

fit_apc <- apc(fit)
plot(fit_apc, cumulative = TRUE)
```
