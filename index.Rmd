# Surveil 

<img src="man/figures/logo.png" align="right" width="160" />

### Public health surveillance 

#### Measure and monitor health inequalities

#### Cumulative and period percent change

#### Age standardization methods

#### Fully Bayesian inference

### Installation

From **R** (>= version 4.05), install **surveil** using:

``` r
if (!require(drat)) install.packages("drat")
drat::addRepo("connordonegan")
install.packages("surveil")
```

### Usage

Model time series data of moratlity or disease incidence by loading the **surveil** package into R together with disease surveillance data. Tables exported from CDC WONDER are automatically in the correct format.

```{r}
library(surveil)
library(knitr)
data(cancer)

kable(head(cancer), 
      booktabs = TRUE,
      caption = "Table 1. A glimpse of cancer surveillance data")
```


Model trends in risk with the `stan_rw` function, and easily view functions of risk estimates, such as cumulative percent change:

```{r eval = FALSE}
fit <- stan_rw(data = cancer,
               time = Year,
               group = Age)

fit_apc <- apc(fit)
plot(fit_apc, cumulative = TRUE)
```
